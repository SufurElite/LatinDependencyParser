# Utils

Utils became the location of the LatinBERT scripts. The code in the LatinBERT directory is almost entirely from : https://github.com/dbamman/latin-bert, but it has some changes. Moreover, the download script was not working since google drive cautioned against the download, so those files were downloaded manually.

If I find the modifications here are present or addressed in the latin-bert repository (or if the code there works in this project without modification), I will add the repository as a submodule and provide instructions in this README.
